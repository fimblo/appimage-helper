* appimage-helper

A tool to easily run and manage AppImages

** Problems I want to solve

*** I want to organise AppImages in one place
- Given there's no standard place to store AppImages
- When I want to find my downloaded AppImages
- Then I don't know where to look
*** I want AppImages to work smoothly in a terminal
- Given AppImages are designed to be executed from a Window Manager or
  Desktop Environment
- When I start the AppImage from the command-line
- Then the program does not fork into the background, and I find the
  logs dumped to stdout/stderr ugly

** How to use appimage-helper
*** Running an Appimage

=appimage-helper.sh= looks at how it was called and starts the correct
AppImage.

Say you have an AppImage, whose filename is
=CoolProgram-1.14.2.AppImage=. After installing it, you can run it
from your terminal by running =coolprogram=.
*** Installing an Appimage

Let's say you've just downloaded an AppImage to your =~/Downloads=
directory. To install it, run =install-appimage.sh= with the path to
the AppImage as parameter.

#+begin_src shell
  $ install-appimage.sh ~/Downloads/CoolProgram-1.14.2.AppImage
  Moved /home/fimblo/Downloads/CoolProgram-1.14.2.AppImage to /home/fimblo/.local/share/appimages
  Created symlink in /home/fimblo/.local/bin for coolprogram
  $
#+end_src

*** Listing installed AppImages

#+begin_src shell
  $ install-appimage.sh -l
  cursor      ->  cursor-0.18.8-build-2312098ffjr3ign.AppImage
  chrysalis   ->  chrysalis-0.12.0.appimage
  coolprogram ->  CoolProgram-1.14.8.AppImage
  $
#+end_src

*** Uninstalling an AppImage

#+begin_src shell
  $ install-appimage.sh -u coolprogram
  Removed '/home/fimblo/.local/share/appimages//home/fimblo/.local/share/appimages/CoolProgram-1.14.8.AppImage'
  Removed symlink in '/home/fimblo/.local/bin' for 'CoolProgram'
  $
#+end_src
