* appimage-helper
tool to easily run and manage appimages
** Problems I want to solve
*** I want to organise AppImages in one place
- Given there's no standard place to store AppImages
- When I want to find my AppImages
- Then I don't know where to look
*** I want AppImages to work smoothly in a terminal
- Given AppImages are designed to be executed from a WindowManager or DesktopEnvironment
- When I start the AppImage from the commandline
- Then the program does not start in the background, and I find the logs dumped to stdout/stderr ugly
